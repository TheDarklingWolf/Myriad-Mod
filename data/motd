This version introduces a new concept: unarmed styles!

You can start with a style if you choose the Martial Arts
Training trait, and NPCs will teach many more (22 styles exist!)

Select your style with _ and wield it with w-

Each style has a variety of special moves associated with it,
and most have some other unique effect--from special combos to
the exotic like wall-running and damage resistance.

This release also sees the return of wandering NPCs.  If you
don't want wandering NPCs in your game, you can turn them off
by placing a file called no_npc.txt in your data folder.
